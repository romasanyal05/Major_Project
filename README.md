# 🛡️ PhishGuard

### **Multi-Engine Phishing & Quishing Detection System Powered by Cognitive Intelligence Heuristics & Dynamic APIs**

---

## 🌟 Overview

**PhishGuard** is an advanced, production-grade cybersecurity intelligence platform designed to intercept, analyze, and explain digital social engineering attacks. By combining deterministic lexical heuristics, dynamic multi-database threat intelligence queries, machine vision analysis, and large language model explainers, PhishGuard protects users from sophisticated phishing, quishing (QR code manipulation), email fraud, and visual brand impersonation campaigns.

PhishGuard features a high-availability design that seamlessly shifts to local SQL database mocks during cloud server outages, and routes AI chat queries to a fallback provider if rate limits are hit. Packaged as a robust monorepo utilizing React 19, TypeScript, Express, Drizzle ORM, and Supabase.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Social engineering attacks represent a significant threat to global digital infrastructure. Modern threat vectors have evolved past simple email templates:
1. **Multi-Vector Attacks**: Phishing attacks are heavily diversified across URLs, structured emails, physical QR codes (Quishing), and visual brand spoofing.
2. **Cognitive Blindspots**: Traditional security tools output raw technical threat metrics (e.g., `Google Safe Browsing: Flagged as SOCIAL_ENGINEERING`) that confuse non-technical users.
3. **Reactive blacklists**: Single-feed security checkers are vulnerable to zero-day domains that have not yet been blacklisted.

---

## 💡 The Solution

PhishGuard provides a proactive, multi-tier threat aggregation and explanation system:
- **Heuristics & APIs**: Combines local lexical scanners with simultaneous queries to VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing, and AbuseIPDB.
- **Natural Language Explanations**: Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain threat signatures to users in simple, natural language.
- **Resilient Infrastructure**: Guarantees high availability using local database and API fallback pipelines.
- **Unified Command Center**: Renders telemetry data, trend charts, and chat interfaces in a responsive dark-mode dashboard.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔐 1. Authentication & RBAC
- Stateless session management using secure, signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Secure password encryption using the **bcrypt** hashing algorithm.
- Middleware verification to enforce standard and administrator account access bounds.

### 🌐 2. URL Scanner
- Heuristic checks scan targets for suspicious keywords, subdomains, character entropy, and age indicators.
- Simultaneously aggregates live scoring metrics from VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing, and AbuseIPDB.
- Consolidates threat data into a single risk scorecard (0-100) and risk level.

### 📧 3. Email Analyzer
- Parses message content for urgency indicators, payment requests, and sensitive data prompts (e.g., SSN, credit cards).
- Compares sender signatures against link profiles to flag mismatch anomalies.
- Automatically extracts and scans embedded URLs.

### 📱 4. QR Scanner (Quishing Defender)
- Pre-processes images using Jimp to optimize contrast and thresholding levels.
- Decodes QR code matrices into plain-text targets using the `jsQR` algorithm.
- Safely evaluates decoded destination URLs before they reach a user's smartphone.

### 👁️ 5. Screenshot AI (Impersonation Defender)
- Extracts hidden layout texts from screenshots using image text recognition.
- Uses vision LLMs to detect visual brand impersonation attempts on login screens (e.g., mimicking Google Accounts sign-in layouts).

### 💬 6. Companion AI Assistant
- Interactive cybersecurity co-pilot that explains complex threat indicators and security vocabulary.
- Features a fallback pipeline to route chat queries to Gemini automatically if OpenAI is unavailable, guaranteeing constant uptime.

### ⚖️ 7. Threat Comparison Tool
- Runs side-by-side risk scans and outputs an AI-synthesized verdict explaining which target represents the greater security risk.

### 📄 8. Actionable PDF Threat Reports
- Generates and downloads professionally formatted PDF reports in the browser, complete with scan findings and custom incident response steps.

### 📊 9. Dashboard Telemetry & Analytics
- Renders per-user scan stats, risk category breakdowns, and weekly scan volumes using responsive charts.

### ⚙️ 10. Admin Console
- Renders central platform statistics, including 30-day telemetry trends, risk distributions, and operator tables.
